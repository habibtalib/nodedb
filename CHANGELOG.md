## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-07

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **`NodeDb` trait** — `vector_search` and `text_search` gained an `allowed_ids` prefilter parameter. Existing callers and trait implementors must update their signatures.
- **`GraphStmt::GraphAlgo`** — added a `personalization` field; `GRAPH ALGO ... ON <collection>` now also accepts a quoted collection name. Exhaustive matches on this variant must be updated.

### Added

- **Personalized PageRank (PPR)** — seed-biased PageRank end to end: `GRAPH ALGO PAGERANK ... PERSONALIZATION {"node": weight, ...}` over the SQL DSL and via the raw native protocol (`algo_params.personalization_vector`); honored by the engine's teleport/dangling redistribution. `graph_pagerank` exposed on the `NodeDb` trait and both client transports.
- **Hybrid-search prefiltering** — `allowed_ids` candidate restriction on `vector_search` and `text_search`; predicate-filtered shape subscriptions and snapshots in sync.
- **Linear-weight RRF fusion** — `reciprocal_rank_fusion_linear` with per-list weights and deterministic tie-breaking across all fusion variants.
- **Graph observability** — `SHOW GRAPH STATS` with persistent O(1) edge-store counters, tenant-wide aggregation, and `AS OF SYSTEM TIME`; `GraphStats` wire type. `graph_stats` on the `NodeDb` trait and both backends.
- **pgwire / SQL surface** — in-process evaluator for `pg_catalog` virtual tables; `SHOW ROLES`, `SHOW STATS`, `SHOW METRICS`, `SHOW MEMORY`, `SHOW TENANT <name|id>`, `SHOW TENANTS WITH NAME`; superuser session tenant switching via `SET TENANT`; `CREATE INDEX` / `DROP INDEX` planning; `IF [NOT] EXISTS` and `WITH ADMIN` on auth DDL; `COLLECTION` / `TABLE` / `TENANT` object types in `GRANT` / `REVOKE`; `TenantSelector` for name-based tenant references; `SEARCH` function alias and JSON vector literals.
- **Bitemporal documents** — `NodedbStatement` and `Namespace` extended for bitemporal document reads/writes; `LatestVersion` namespace for O(1) live-version lookups; history namespaces.
- **Sync** — inbound sync handlers and wire types for columnar, vector, FTS, and spatial engines; Data-Plane sync ingest ops; DDL changes broadcast to connected Lite sessions after catalog commit.
- **Vector** — multi-dtype storage for HNSW indexes with `storage_dtype` propagated through vector-primary DDL and the upsert path; `VectorSegmentBacking` trait + `PlainMmapBacking`; versioned envelope for quantization codecs.
- **wasm32** — compatibility guards across memory governor, WAL, and vector so the embedded/WASM build links.

### Fixed

- `ALTER USER` / `ALTER ROLE` parsers no longer apply silent fallbacks on unrecognized clauses.
- `GRANT` grantees canonicalized as `user:<name>` or bare role name.
- `SHOW` commands routed through the DDL router before session-parameter handling.
- Native client edge properties serialized without a runtime JSON pass and no longer silently dropped on a serializer error.
- FTS hot paths no longer emit debug `eprintln`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Database primitive** — `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `USE`, and `SHOW DATABASE`; database context bound at connection handshake and propagated through WAL, catalog, routing, and planner
- **CLONE DATABASE** — copy-on-write clone with per-engine row materializer, surrogate ceiling for snapshot isolation, and `SHOW DATABASE LINEAGE FOR`
- **MOVE TENANT** — relocate a tenant's collections between databases
- **Mirror database** — cross-cluster read-only replica via Raft Observer role; lag monitor and automatic restart recovery
- **OIDC authentication** — bearer token auth with provider DDL (`CREATE OIDC PROVIDER`) and catalog persistence
- **Per-database audit** — DML audit mode (`ALTER DATABASE SET AUDIT_DML`), database lifecycle events, `user_id` / `statement_digest` propagated through Data Plane and WAL
- **Per-database quotas** — resource budgets for databases and tenants (`ALTER DATABASE SET QUOTA`); sum-of-quotas enforcement; live cap updates
- **Weighted-fair queue** — per-database DRR dispatch in the SPSC bridge; per-database and per-tenant QPS buckets; connection admission control
- **Per-database metrics** — dedicated Prometheus series per database; per-database CPU budget tracker for compaction enforcement
- **DocCache sharding** — shard document cache by `database_id` with weighted eviction
- **ClusterAdmin role** — cluster-wide admin identity; `GRANT/REVOKE ON DATABASE`; `ALTER USER SET DEFAULT DATABASE`
- **Session registry** — kill-channel per session, hard-revoke on credential change
- **Credential hardening** — persistent lockout state, per-user credential versioning, pre-authentication login rate limiting
- **Continuous aggregate DDL** — `CREATE CONTINUOUS AGGREGATE` with catalog persistence
- **`SHOW AUDIT WHERE`** — filter clause on audit log queries
- **nodedb-client** — graph DSL, field-aware vector ops, text search, and bound-parameter support (`sql_params`) in the native protocol
- **FTS** — crash-safe LSM compaction with dedicated compaction module
- **Memory governor** — over-release counter on `Budget` and `Governor` for accounting correctness

### Fixed

- `DISTINCT` deduplication now operates on projected output, not raw rows
- `ORDER BY` correctly propagated into aggregate plans; derived-`FROM` subqueries supported
- `DROP COLLECTION IF EXISTS` routed through typed handler so the flag is honoured
- Catalog orphan-row violations self-healed at startup
- `EventPlane` drop no longer silently discards pending `WriteEvent`s
- Consumer-disconnect events misclassified as security violations
- ILP measurement names with `/` now route correctly for database-qualified paths
