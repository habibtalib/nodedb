//! Self-heal pass for `OrphanRow` integrity violations.
//!
//! The startup catalog sanity check used to treat every orphan row
//! as fatal — a single CREATE DDL that landed the primary row
//! without its companion `StoredOwner` (the original
//! single-node bypass bug) would brick boot at the
//! `CatalogSanityCheck` phase with no operator recourse short of
//! wiping `system.redb`.
//!
//! Every parent-replicated `Stored<T>` carries the creator's
//! username in-band (`StoredCollection.owner`,
//! `StoredFunction.owner`, etc. — kept in sync by every applier
//! including `DeactivateCollection`). That is total reconstruction
//! information for the missing `StoredOwner` row, so an orphan is
//! always recoverable without operator action.
//!
//! [`heal_orphan_rows`] runs after `verify_redb_integrity` and
//! before the report is assembled. For every `OrphanRow` whose
//! parent kind is `owner`, it reads the surviving primary row, lifts
//! its `owner` field, and writes the missing `StoredOwner` back to
//! the `OWNERS` table. Healed divergences are dropped from the
//! returned list; anything we can't repair (the primary row really
//! is gone, or the catalog write fails) stays in
//! `integrity_violations` and still aborts startup.
